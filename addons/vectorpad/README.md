## VectorPad for Godot 4

Interactive Vector2 pad for the Godot Inspector.

### What it is
- **Inspector control for Vector2**: Replaces any `Vector2` property in the Inspector with a compact, draggable pad.
- **Precise numeric editing**: Synced X/Y fields stay aligned with the pad at all times.
- **Clear visuals**: Grid, axes, circular boundary, vector line, and handle rendered via a custom shader.
- **Live updates**: If your script changes the vector at runtime, the pad reflects it immediately.
